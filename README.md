# TP Random Forest

This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest model applied to a
given dataset using a Jupyter Notebook.\
The notebook `Random_Forest.ipynb` contains all steps from data loading
to model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Project Structure

-   `Random_Forest.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the full machine
    learning workflow using Random Forest.
-   `README.md`: Documentation explaining how to run the project.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

-   Python 3.8 or higher
-   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
-   The following Python libraries:
    -   numpy
    -   pandas
    -   matplotlib
    -   scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies with:

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## How to Run the Notebook

1.  Clone this repository:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    git clone https://github.com/<votre-utilisateur>/<votre-repository>.git

2.  Navigate to the project folder:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    cd <votre-repository>

3.  Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    jupyter notebook

4.  Open the file `Random_Forest.ipynb`.

## Workflow Description

### 1. Data Loading

The notebook loads the dataset and performs initial inspection before
processing.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

Steps may include: - Cleaning or handling missing values\
- Encoding variables\
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

### 3. Random Forest Model

The notebook implements a Random Forest workflow including: - Model
initialization\
- Model training\
- Hyperparameter tuning (if present)\
- Performance evaluation

### 4. Visualization

The notebook displays visualizations such as: - Feature importance\
- Performance metrics\
- Relevant charts based on the dataset

### 5. Interpretation

The obtained results are analyzed, and conclusions are drawn regarding
model performance and feature influence.

## Reproducibility

All steps are executed sequentially in the notebook.\
Ensure that dependencies are installed and that any required dataset is
correctly placed.
